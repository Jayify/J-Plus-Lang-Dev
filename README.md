# J-Plus-Lang
***
**Description**

Officially known as "J+" but can be referred to as "J Plus," "JPlus" or J-Plus."

This language was created by Jayden Houghton to experiment and learn about the creation and back workings of programming languages.

This language is designed to supply the basic functionality of a programming language in a lightweight package, making it suitable for beginner programmers to learn with before moving on to more complex and feature rich languages.
